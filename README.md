Zoo Photos
=========

A simple iPad app to browse zoo photos from Flickr.

I wrote this app in about two hours just for myself since I wanted to see the results sets of Flickr photos for specific searches since I wanted to have similar searches in another app. Therefore the code of this project is coded quick and dirty and certain parts are copy pasted from other projects.

This app also includes source files taken from https://github.com/justinmfischer/core-background

Requirements
----------

Xcode 5, iOS 7 SDK and Cocoa Pods.
This app was built and tested for iOS 7 beta 6.

How To Use
----------

Clone this repository and run 'pod install'. Then open 'ZooPhotos.xcworkspace'.
